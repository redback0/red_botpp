# Reworked economy system
wallet -> gems
gems will work similarly to how the current wallet works; you can daily and
steal. However, you will no longer deposit to the bank.

bank -> red_coin
red_coin will be earned via a new system of "generators"

+ generator
your first generator will be bought with gems, with better generators costing
red_coin as well.
generators will give a certain red_coin per second, which is semi random from
when you bought it.
potentially, generators will be upgradable as well.
you'll be ranked by how much red_coin you have
